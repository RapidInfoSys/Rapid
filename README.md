#What is Rapid?
Rapid is an open source drag and drop web application builder for desktop and mobile. Apps can be created without code, and there are extendable interfaces for database connections, web services, security, and more. It has a light-weight footprint and avoids bloated, slow-to-load code. Rapid is the tool to support the modern, lean, agile, open approach to software.
