These files are minified from JavaScript resource files on application initilisation.

They are placed here as they need to have the same relative path depth as the original resource files.

There are some rules:
- they must be of type "javascriptFile"
- their "contents" must start with "scripts/" and end with ".js"
- they must not exist already (since resources are updated so seldom and shared between applications there is no point constantly rebuilding them)

With the exception of jquery*.js they are all excluded from source control
